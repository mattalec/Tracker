3, Server vs Serverless,"Serverless = mix of 3rd party services, event-driven and counting on cloud-hosted remodte procedure calls - Faas (Functions as a service)

3 different cloud vendors:
- Iaas (infrastructure as a service) => veritual machines, servers, storage, perating systems and networks
- Paas (Platform as a service) -> utilized for software development, softyware testiung and software maintenacne. Unlike Iaas, Paas denoted DBMS, BI services etc (otherwise its the same).
- Saas (software as a service) -> makes users connect to applications through the internet on a subsciption basis

Serverless Framework - Javascript, Python, Golang
Apex - Javascript
Gordon - Javascript
ClaudiaJS - Javascript
Sparta - Golang

Pros:
Pricing as based on traffic
Reduced Maintenance
Scalability
Faster Delivery
Easier to set up different environments
Security

Cons:
vendor-operated environemt
